## Hello!
After completing the course on git commands, I learnt a lot of commands that I didn't even know existed before: rebase, checkout, options of push, pull, and fetch. So, this course was really useful and I enjoyed it, even though it took a lot of time. Actualy all commands is usefull, so, for my mind, sooner or later I'll use them all

##Hello!
My impression from this course is quite exciting due to the fact that git appears more flexible and adventurous than i thought earlier. Thanks to the work i've done by completing this course, my knowledge ofg it now is not something that i embarassed of.
