# Web-programming. Learning git.

## Hi there ðŸ«¡

I`m Kuruliak Eduard. My emotions after taking this course are quite mixed. You definitely need to know this, but still, the commands in the console are not very convenient. It is easier and faster to use the IDE functionality

## Hi!

I am Artem Karachevtsev.
Greetings to all!

## Hello!

After completing the course on git commands, I've learnt a lot of commands that I didn't even know existed before: rebase, checkout, options of push, pull, and fetch. So this course was really useful, and I enjoyed it, even though it took a lot of time. Actually, all commands are useful, so, I think, sooner or later I'll use them all

## Hi!

When I finished this course I understood many Git features. I've discovered a lot of git commands and I think that it will help me in the future. Also I've got to know how to use GitHub and I find it very useful and interesting. I want to improve my skills and hope that in the future I would be able to use them all!

## Wassup!

I'm Biliakov Artem, CHnU student on my second year. And this is a message for the first lab on web-programming. Git is kinda cool, it's very functional and versatile. Overall I've liked learning more about it. And I think I'll use it at full potential someday.

As I have the right to write whatever I want, I'll leave my steam account page here, in case you want to play with someone. https://steamcommunity.com/id/BeliyDot/
I may not answer immediately, I can be busy, but maybe we can play one day.

That's all. Cya, sigmas.
